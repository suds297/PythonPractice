    "Requirements-\n",
    "1. Should provide at least 2 methods/techniques to treat outliers\n",
    "2. Should allow you to choose an index/identifier variable that you don't want to treat(eg. customer_id)\n",
    "3. Should allow you to pass a list of continuous variables (since you may also have categorical variables that you don't want treated)- even better if it automatically detects these for you \n",
    "4. Be able to process a dataframe and give you an output of what it has done to each of the variables \n",
    "5. Bonus points if your code does diagnostics before it treats your variables/columns\n",
